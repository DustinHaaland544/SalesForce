Step not yet complete … We had an issue checking your challenge Error:

1. Refresh & Retry

  - Click Check Challenge again after refreshing the page.
  - Sometimes Trailhead servers hiccup and don’t validate properly on the first attempt.

2. Log Out & Log Back In

  - Log out of Trailhead.
  - Log back into the correct Trailhead Playground (TP) where you made the changes.
  - Make sure the playground you’re checking against is the one you customized.

3. Verify You’re in the Correct Playground

  - In the challenge, click the dropdown next to “Launch” and confirm it’s pointing to My Trailhead Playground 1 (not a different org).
  - If you made changes in another playground, Trailhead won’t detect them.

4. Check the Home Page Customization

  - Go to Setup → App Builder → Lightning App Builder.
  - Confirm you customized the default Home Page or the one tied to your app.
  - Ensure you activated and assigned it (e.g., “Set as Org Default” or “App Default”).
  - If you only edited but didn’t activate, Trailhead won’t detect it.

5. Clear Cache / Incognito Mode

  - Clear your browser cache or try running Trailhead in an Incognito/Private window.
  - Sometimes cached sessions cause validation glitches.

  - Pro Tip: Trailhead checks for very specific things. For “Customize the Home Page” it usually expects:

    -> You used Lightning App Builder to modify the Home Page.
    -> You added a standard component (e.g., Key Deals, Assistant, Dashboard).
    -> You activated the page and set it as default.
