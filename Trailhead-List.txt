TRAILHEAD LIST

You do not need to hunt each badge one-by-one. You have got two easy ways:

1.Use an official, prebuilt path (zero setup).
	-Admin Beginner trail – everything is already listed and ordered; just work top-to-bottom. 
	-Prepare for your Salesforce Administrator credential (official Trailmix) – curated by Salesforce specifically for the exam. Open it and click “Start.”

2.Follow my custom sequence below (with direct links).
If you prefer my step-by-step order, just keep this list and click through; no searching needed. You can also paste these into your own Trailmix (instructions right after the list).
